# Crime-Intent
android application 2 from the book "The Big Nerd Ranch guide"

through building this app, the book provided knowledge of:

- using and handling fragments (activityâ€™s internal business)
   - the difference between the fragment lifecycle and the activity lifecycle is that fragment lifecycle methods are called by the hosting 
     activity, not the OS
- layout fragment vs custom fragment with java code
- FragmentManager handles: list of fragments and back stack of fragment transactions
- singleton
- ListFragment, ListView, ArrayAdapter
- customizing listview
- adapter subclass -communication between fragments -ViewPager
